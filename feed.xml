Every single person I know who has gone or is going through a PhD told me that they experienced something to this effect. It’s one of the things that makes a doctorate – which can look like a breezy time of study and self-development from the outside – into a test of patience and frustration. There’s some variance in who experiences it and how much of it, but some of it is always there.</p> <p>One of the dominating aspects of the PhD is the carrot called graduation, dangling in front of your eyes for years on end, like a guiding star, and equally untouchable. Everything you do is supposed to contribute to this main goal, but sure as hell as soon as you are lost in the jungle of papers, teaching, and all the little extra things that pile up, it’s quite freaking hard to see clearly what contributes to this path. Papers, you are told, papers are the bread and butter, publish papers often and publish them someplace good and things sort themselves out. And then your papers get rejected and what seemed like stepping stones before are now dark pits of despair. It’s quite some struggle.</p> <p>You know all this, it’s part of the mutual understanding between academics to-be. But although we all experience it and are good at rationalizing it, the dark webby feelings that these experiences build are hard to shake off. One thing that can help to make these feelings less dramatic is perspective: To know how your experience relates to others’ experiences in the bigger picture. This is what this text is meant to give. It builds on the experience of me visiting a French university for four months, located south of Paris in a town called Palaiseau – and any person living in Paris will immediately challenge its funny name, <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home">Télécom Paris</a>, because <em>it’s not quite in Paris is it</em>??</p> <p>Anyhow, the idea of the stay was to get into touch with other researches and structures and to work out a paper to submit to a conference on a topic that was related to my own. It all worked out better than I ever expected, and that is even though the paper was rejected in the end. Papers get rejected (and resubmitted) all the time, but what mattered really were other things – being in another building and working with other people and seeing them struggle and seeing them graduate. In some way, the combination of these experiences put a new framing to this whole PhD business, which I try to put down in this text to inspire whoever needs to hear it.</p> <p>In essence, what I took away was perspective on three things: completion, freedom, and acceptance. But before we get to this – just to be sure we’re on the same page – what’s so hard again about doing a PhD?</p> <h3 id="there-are-so-many-ways-to-fail">There are so many ways to fail</h3> <p>We said above that it’s not always clear what contributes to the final goal of graduation. I think large parts of what makes a PhD difficult struggle can be tied to this circumstance, that what you put in does not easily relate to what comes out. The following is my simplified three-point dissection of three factors contributing to this uncertainty to explain why it’s easy to lose track of progress or believe that no progress is taking place.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Arbitrariness</strong>: <em>To put in effort does not output success in the same measure</em>.<br/> In many other things in life, the more time and energy you invest, the better the result will be. Sports work like that, exams work like that, hobbies do, and so on. And yet, with PhDs, this somewhat linear relationship breaks down. Nearly every doctoral student I met has been putting in a lot of effort, and still it does not seem to guarantee success. It’s easy to find reasons: It would be odd to expect that your submissions land from the get-go, there’s a learning curve involved; also, we all know <a href="https://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/the-neurips-experiment-snsf.html">it’s a number’s game</a> and you may just have bad luck with the reviewers; and anyway, this is how research works, if your contribution is not good enough it gets rejected until it is. Sure, that’s all true, but what we’re left with is the feeling that more effort does not mean more success necessarily, and it can make it look like it’s a game of luck, one that’s rigged for someone else. Why then do we struggle so freaking hard, if it’s all luck anyway? (You see the rhetorical exaggeration, but then again it’s not so far from reality, I’ve heard this exact statement multiple times.) It’s easy to understand how one can despair over this thought.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stagnation</strong>: <em>To put in effort does not feel like it outputs success at all</em>. The feeling of stagnation is related to arbitrariness, but different: We see that what we do has an effect, but it does not have an effect on the actual success measure, which is the number of papers and graduation. In my bubble, publications are the only thing that really counts towards graduation in a formal way. Not the teaching, not the conference visits, not the student supervision, not the research stays, not the connections, but the papers. It’s a slim measure, quite compact, easy to grasp. And devilishly, you can spend years putting energy into all the other things I listed and they will reward you on their own terms, but they will not contribute directly to the one success measure that rules them all. It can feel frustrating - are all these things not part of what makes academia worthwhile? And here comes the vital difference, as I see it: These extracurricular activities produce progress on the way to <em>academia</em>, which is a broader and much longer path than the path to <em>graduation</em>. But graduation is a gatekeeper, and it only takes papers for payment. Unfortunately, even focusing on papers can be unsuccessful, which takes us back to point one. Coincidentally, this focus on paper output, captured in the saying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish">publish or perish</a>, was identified as one of the factors that drove the replication crisis, as it incentivized “prioritization of research quantity over quality”. Don’t trust me on this, trust this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00003-2">Nature article</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Unattainability</strong>: <em>To put in effort is in vain, success does not exist</em>. If arbitrariness and stagnation mix in an unholy alliance, graduation can seem more and more unlikely. If it’s the guiding star in good times, a sufficient amount of bad luck, frustration, and external hardships can make it blurry to a degree that you doubt it was ever there in the first place. This moment of perception is not far from an existential crisis and it can tip people over, losing hope that it will come to an end and believing that all the past struggle was for nothing. This feeling certainly is one of the heaviest weights in a PhD, especially since we know that many people do, in fact, not graduate. One number to capture this effect is how many doctoral students take longer than expected or quit altogether, which seemed to be <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0158037X.2015.1055463">around 60% in Europe</a> in 2015 (averaged over disciplines). This pit can be quite dark. But against all this intimidating backdrop, it’s good to remember that there are people who do in fact finish (and that people who do not finish most likely have very happy lives!). To French speakers, I can recommend a <a href="https://www.seuil.com/ouvrage/carnets-de-these-tiphaine-riviere/9782021125948">fantastic comic</a> that tells such a story with great charm.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Alright, these are the three apocalyptic riders of PhD struggle. Now that everyone’s afraid, we can come to the part that brings back the light.</p> <h3 id="completion-it-is-entirely-possible-to-graduate">Completion: It is entirely possible to graduate</h3> <p>Let’s start with an anecdote.</p> <p>While I was at Télécom, I met many doctoral students who were closing in on the end of their PhDs – hiring and finishing was done in waves rather than continuously and I happened to arrive just at the end of one such wave. During the four months I stayed, I got to know <em>seven</em> people who defended their theses and finished. At my home university, I only had witnessed one defense from my research group and was aware that two or three had taken place in other groups, in a span of 2 ½ years. But when, on a daily basis, I met people who were just about to finish their PhD, even with all the caveats and struggle attached, it somehow normalized the step of graduation. When watching others stand in front of their jury committee, presenting their PhD work, and being awarded the title, it does not seem so unattainable after all. Rather naturally you ask yourself how you would fare in this situation, and when that may be the case. Witnessing other people graduate shifts completion back into the realm of the real.</p> <p>Among all these PhD defenses there was only one story, from back in ancient times, of someone who had not passed it. It was in the area of mathematics and the whole thesis built on a specific proof, which the student presented and defended before the jury committee. After the jury was done with their questions, the audience was routinely asked for any remaining remarks, and one audience member spoke up to ask something very specific. If it was not addressed, this question would invalidate the presented proof. And tragically, the student could not rebut this, and neither could the jury members (nobody is there to see a student <em>not pass</em>), and since the proof constituted the whole of the thesis’ contribution, the title could not be awarded. While we should sit in a minute of silence for this student, it also shows that circumstances need to be quite particular for things to go wrong when you made it to the defense.</p> <p>What I took away from the many graduations and the many moments of happy celebrations (students’ families and friends often cook for days to create a large buffet for the after-defense party) at Télécom, is that it is absolutely possible to graduate. Normal even, people do it all the time. If you doubt that it can be done, watch other people do it. Of course, context varies, and serious hardships might impede the whole thing. But then again, one of the French graduates experienced quite serious hardships with their supervision, topic, and personal life, and still they freaking did it. It can be done.</p> <h3 id="freedom-you-can-choose-what-you-do">Freedom: You can choose what you do</h3> <p>The word is incredibly cheese, but I cannot find a term that better captures this perspective change. With freedom I mean the re-realization that research offers a degree of freedom in your work that is hard to find someplace else. You may know it from back when you chose a dissertation topic, or just before starting the next paper, in these moments where everything seems possible and you just need to pick a place to land. It’s wonderful, but also terrifying and hard to handle - how should you make any informed decision about where to land? It’s terrifying because this choice needs to be measured against our one and only success measure. But when, for a moment, you put aside this limiting view, it’s really an offer to follow and study anything you might find interesting.</p> <p>In France, I became aware of this freedom in a mix of circumstances: For one, my own supervision did not have articulate expectations about what should happen during this stay (apart from it should result in a paper). Similarly, my collaborators on-site were curiously interested and engaged, but not dependent on the project outcome. This meant that both topic and approach were not pre-determined and could be adapted to study what we found interesting. Of course, the general area was set by the <a href="https://www.institutfrancais.at/bgf">French research stipend</a> that funded parts of my stay. But within these very broad confines, it was nothing short of luxury. And for the first time I believe I understood what it’s like to work as a researcher in a best case academic scenario.</p> <p>Now, if we are realistic, there are never no expectations to fulfill or goals to meet. This particular situation was made possible by a considerable financial propping through both my home contract and the stipend. That is, freedom in content was supported by freedom in finances (as it so often is). But again, it’s not witchcraft, it’s funding and a cool environment - things that are not easy to find but that are <em>definitely</em> findable.</p> <p>Two extra anecdotes on job hunts and team dynamics:</p> <p>When we were talking about the big ever-after of the PhD, one of my colleagues told the story of how they tackled finding a Postdoc position. What are you when you graduate? For one, a researcher who proved that you can work independently and contribute something. But you are also part of a large network of people who are interested in strange ideas and complex problems. So instead of applying for Postdoc positions right away, this colleague wrote to research groups and asked if they could meet for a chat, to present the PhD work, to see what the group’s research was about, to just kind of hang for a bit. The overwhelming majority was happy to invite the colleague, which resulted in an academic roadtrip of something like 12 research groups. Naturally, several of them offered up Postdoc positions, but finally, the result was Télécom Paris. I found the whole idea brave and creative. Yes, it’s about employment, but it’s also about the best fit with topic and team. Why not prioritize finding this best fit?</p> <p>And this segues nicely into the second thought: The team dynamic in our office at Télécom was wholesome to a degree it sounds tacky. Not knowing each other at the start, before long we began to share hobbies and knitted and went climbing together, with regular happenings and get-togethers for board games and movies. Every day I looked forward to going to work to meet our office crew, and critically, they all actually were in the office most of the time, which was a bit of an oddity at Télécom, a school so removed that people need to commute for 40+ minutes from Paris. The dynamic was certainly fuelled by many context factors, but the experience created a kind of certainty that it is possible to find such a dynamic, and that it’s well worth looking for.</p> <h3 id="acceptance-peace-of-mind-is-a-strategy">Acceptance: Peace of mind is a strategy</h3> <p>In combination, it all sounds like the motto of some spiritual journey program, doesn’t it? But in fact, it’s strategy: Managing your resources (funding, mental health, time, etc.) to “finish your PhD before it finishes you” - the point is so evident that it became a proverb. With this in mind, my point on acceptance is that some battles are better to fight than others.</p> <p>Structural factors are a bit different at Télécom compared to the Uni Vienna. Most notably, standard contracts run for three years there, instead of four here (though the percent of hours might be different). And there’s no hard limit of having a specific number of publications, the focus is on the thesis instead. So the success metric is a bit more lenient, while the time frame is not, three years is what you get.</p> <p>Does this produce stress and hyperventilation? Absolutely, just as it does here. I talked to people about pros and cons and I’m not sure there’s a clear preference – people are equally stressed and the path to success is equally murky. Yes, having three published papers is somewhat oppressing, but Austrian PhD students (and academics) are paid more on average. Yes, being done in three years is nice, but maybe another one would help you build your profile. In my mind, perks and drawbacks somehow balance out.</p> <p>I said above that the three points of struggle can make it feel like the PhD game is rigged for someone else. Visiting the Télécom made me think it’s rigged for nobody, it’s just a bit bad in general. People are stressed and things move too slow or too quick and there’s quarrel between students and professors and administration, output is prioritized over long thought, there’s not enough funding and university politics interfere with research etc etc. To be fair, I didn’t visit Harvard or the MIT or Oxford, perhaps things are different there, paradisal, easy and unencumbered, but I doubt it. I think accepting that it’s just somewhat bad in general can be a path to mental peace. With this I do not mean accepting that it naturally has to be this way or that it’s good like it is (or any form of power abuse or harassment and such). But accepting that, as a PhD student, playing along within reasonable bounds and taking it one notch less serious might be ok. From my French senior colleagues I received the advice that some sort of break should follow the PhD, because one is too exhausted from the whole circus to deliver something meaningful anytime soon after graduation. I suspect that part of this break is to get some distance from the academic system as well, which does funny things to your head when you stay in it for longer times on end.</p> <h3 id="so-what-can-a-research-stay-do-for-you">So, what can a research stay do for you?</h3> <p>It gives perspective, and this perspective can be relieving. Seeing others tread the same path, seeing others curse at familiar problems, seeing others overcome considerable challenge, it all sheds new light on known issues. By having new points of reference to relate your own experiences to, it might change how you feel about the struggle, and it might help making it that much less existential. Of course, the obligatory disclaimer is that no research stay is the same and that all of these things might also be observed close to home. But I do believe that uprooting yourself from the usual surroundings and going someplace new has a value in itself. And that’s not even speaking of culture, language, cuisine, and all the other things that are part of the experience.</p> <p>So, this is what I took away from my research stay, and this is why I would encourage anyone to consider doing one of their own. To wrap up, here are a <strong>few quick and easy pieces of wisdom on the practical aspects</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Many research groups will be happy to host you if you bring your own money. Securing funding is half the battle. Even top schools like Oxford and Cambridge are approachable when you bring your own funding.</li> <li>To secure funding, look up stipends at your uni, at the target uni, at academic exchange programs (like DAAD, ÖAD), and at country-specific education institutions (like Campus France).</li> <li>To find a collaborator (someone who will host and work with you, basically your host-supervisor), look through your list of contacts from conferences, workshops, get-togethers, etc. If you don’t know anyone, look up researchers whose work you find really interesting. Write a friendly and well-motivated mail asking if their groups take visiting researchers.</li> <li>Speak to your supervisors at home to clarify what is expected of you and the project. Consider if they would like to be part of the collaboration and note down what you agree on.</li> <li>When arriving at your exchange place, go to every social event you can find (for some time). I was told that research stays can be lonesome if the office is empty. It’s easy to meet people through language meetings, board games, sports, hikes, book clubs, and the like (the app <em>Meetup</em> has a huge selection of such events).</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for reading! Do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to talk about ways to secure funding, establishing connections abroad, planning the project, and coordinating with your supervisors at home. I’ll be happy to chat and share anything that could be useful.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The perks of doing your PhD research somewhere else for a bit]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Replacing Humans with Machines is a Terrible Idea</title><link href="https://timothee-schmude.github.io//blog/2025/replacing-humans/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Replacing Humans with Machines is a Terrible Idea"/><published>2025-04-06T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-06T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://timothee-schmude.github.io//blog/2025/replacing-humans</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://timothee-schmude.github.io//blog/2025/replacing-humans/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_thumbnail-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_thumbnail-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_thumbnail-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_thumbnail.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Is this what the public agency of the future looks like? What seems like a dystopian building complex is actually just a fancy construction tarp in Bratislava, but it makes quite the impression. </div> <p><em>This is an opinion piece summarizing my thoughts on why putting AI in public institutions to replace people will not solve any problems and might introduce many news ones. You might naturally not agree with all things, but whether you do or do not, I’ll be happy to hear what you think.</em></p> <p>Nearly every day a politician, industry leader, or someone else in power sings the gospel of AI productivity increases. AI, they say, will make things better, faster, stronger, look how much it has already done! It streamlines redundant tasks, codes for us, writes and edits our reports, ads, press statements, there’s nothing it can’t do. All of this might be true and all of this might be just automation going forward. But this talk gets delicate when the same people propose that AI could increase productivity in public institutions. Specifically, in institutions that exist to interact with and support people, like job agencies, social security, and healthcare institutions.</p> <p>The idea of “let’s make the public sector cost less money” already existed before AI became a thing and it has a fancy name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_public_management"><em>New Public Management</em></a>. And here’s the pitch – we should, in the interest of a lean state, organize public institutions like they need to compete on the market. Market forces make <em>private companies</em> better, faster, stronger, why should the same not work in the public sector? The idea surfaced in the 90s and has not gone away. In fact, many public institutions were overhauled with this very idea in mind and re-opened with a big neon sign flashing “<em>now more efficient</em>”.</p> <p>This is to say, even if you’ve never heard the term, new public management is all around. Just as AI is all around. And, surprise, it’s a match: AI is touted as the ultimate tool to usher in a new age of public sector efficiency. I think that this is misguided. And in the following, I will explain why focusing on three key issues: the way public institutions measure success, the danger of algorithmic imprints, and the legacy of flawed structures.</p> <h3 id="public-institutions-performance-metrics-are-skewed-beyond-belief">Public institutions’ performance metrics are skewed beyond belief</h3> <p>When talking to people who work in public institutions, you notice that many of them care about the people they work with. Who does not care about the people they work with are algorithms. Who cares sometimes, and sometimes not, about these people are policy-makers that decide about the course of direction for public sector bodies. A policy-maker might think: These institutions are spending money on people who do not actually need it or deserve it, and besides, they don’t deliver enough throughput per day. This message is packaged and ribboned in the phrase “They need to be more efficient.”</p> <p>Remember: Efficiency means minimizing spent resources for a particular outcome. Now let’s apply this lens to how public institutions work and let’s take a job agency as example. What is the job of a job agency? The intuitive answer is bringing people into work. Thus, framing the job agency’s work under the lens of efficiency means optimizing a function that takes job counsellors’ time as input and produces new hours worked or vacant positions filled as output; this lens on things creates a convenient statistical relationship that can be modelled and put into algorithms, such as a logistic regression. The algorithm can then predict performance in terms of efficiency and even provide decision-making assistance to maximize this metric. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.3217/978-3-85125-668-0-16">6</a>]</p> <p>What does applying efficiency as a performance metric mean in practice? It means that Harald, an older guy with a knee issue and only eight years of school in his education record, will instantly be rerouted to a facility that acts as the oubliette for non-employables. Because this way of action minimizes counsellors’ time spent on a cumbersome hardcore case and shifts its subpar records to the statistics of another agency. You understand that the optimal sample of job-seekers for an agency running under the goal of efficiency would be a population of well-educated, compliant, flexible mid-twenties who can be left to their own devices with barely any intervention. Efficiency would quickly approximate 90+%.</p> <p>But in reality, a job agency neither deals with an exclusive clientele of malleable young professionals nor is their only job to be the stepstone for easily reachable employment. While the willing twenty-somethings exist, the agency’s clientele is much more likely to be composed of people who experienced hardships and cannot simply return to work. They might have been fired, traumatized by bad leadership, bullied by colleagues, grinded through from caring for a family member, and in turn, they might have developed anxiety issues, nagging self-consciousness, or become physically or mentally ill. If you think this is an overexaggeration, I have seen all these issues in different facets and colours while conducting interviews with people at job agencies – it’s not far fetched. People who have trouble staying in employment are rarely lazy, but have serious, real human issues and are in need of support.</p> <p>Trying to frame this support as a measure of efficiency is somewhat laughable. Everyone can agree that agencies should not burn money to no effect, but here comes the catch: The effect of personal counselling on job-seekers in itself is an unobservable property [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445901">5</a>]. We can only approximate its effect through measures like job placement rate, hours of counselling spent, and the job-seekers’ reports and statements. What we cannot easily observe is psychological comfort, reassurance, satisfaction, perception of self – aspects that are equally if not more important when talking about social support.</p> <p>This means that algorithms – by design – are not used to maximize or even improve the factors that make up human connection and experience, but to maximize key performance indices that can be quantified. This is why using algorithms to supplant interpersonal work in an effort to improve efficiency, consciously or unconsciously, de-humanizes the agency’s actual performance goal: letting people support people.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_gauge-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_gauge-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_gauge-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/replacing_humans_gauge.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Every gauge should say what it measures. Picture by Eric Prouzet. </div> <h3 id="algorithms-leave-gigantic-and-very-resistant-imprints">Algorithms leave gigantic and very resistant imprints</h3> <p>Let’s take one step back to the point where the algorithm is not yet implemented in our job agency. The idea has just entered the discussion and there are arguments for both sides: If we implement it, it could raise the agency’s efficiency and give it some fighting ground in the funding negotiations with the city next year. If not, we see it as a pilot phase and simply dismantle it again. What could go wrong?</p> <p>This line of reasoning forgets that many organizations, and public agencies in particular, are not nimble little sailing boats that can take sharp turns, but lumbering cruise ships that are responsible for a host of people and for which every move costs a lot of money. Taking a metaphorical turn to see if there’s a shortcut through that archipelago will be allowed exactly <em>once</em>, and if it turned out to be a bad call neither captain nor crew will take any free action for a long time.</p> <p>What this means is that, once the decision to deploy an algorithmic system has been made, there is absolutely no incentive to truthfully examine whether it’s a blessing or a curse. Money has been spent, personnel has been trained, computers have been set up, job-seekers were informed, everything has been checked by the legal team from top to bottom. How high, do you think, are the chances that any agency will roll this back unless they are forced to?</p> <p>So, one could say, let’s put it in a real test phase, one that allows us to dismantle the whole thing again if it doesn’t turn out right. Only two counsellors will use the thing, and they will only use a prototype, job-seekers will be asked if they are ok with being rated by a machine, decisions are non-binding, and all data is stored and processed locally, so there’s no hassle with the GDPR. After two months the test is evaluated. The presentation is nice enough, but the results are somewhat… mixed? Counsellor A, whose name is Jonathan, says that he used it in the beginning but that the predictions were way off, so he began to ignore it. Counsellor B, whose name is Monika, says that for her clients the predictions were pretty much on point and she started to use the algorithm a lot. As a result – are those numbers true? – the number of job-seekers she counselled rose by 40%, wow, that’s quite a lot! So it’s a win-win, when the predictions are wrong, the counsellor takes over, and when they are not, everything is better, faster, stronger. And anyway it was only a prototype, maybe the predictions will become even better. The manager is already halfway done with <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/brainwash-an-executive-today/">drafting the mail to contract development for the full version</a>.</p> <p>Even if we leave aside that for counsellors like Jonathan this solution would mean an increased workload while having less time to check the system outputs [<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2020.00005">1</a>] – what if both counsellors had Jonathan’s experience? Then the system might go back to development or be cancelled and we would never hear about it. These cases might exist and they would be prime-examples of what successful early-stage testing looks like. But first, this outcome presupposes a lot of requirements (there is a testing phase, the test results are honest and unbiased, the algorithm performs badly, and there’s someone who actually calls deployment off), and second, next time the algorithm might work slightly better and a counsellor might vouch for it, and then we are back to square one. And who knows, maybe this time the algorithm actually does a good job, but the point is this: Systems that are meant to automate human work are nothing that you put in and out on a whim. When they come, they leave imprints [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533186">4</a>], and changing them becomes more difficult the more their implementation has progressed.</p> <h3 id="algorithms-will-not-fix-what-the-prior-structure-screwed-up">Algorithms will not fix what the prior structure screwed up</h3> <p>In one of my interviews, I spoke to a participant who is knowledgeable about law and AI regulation. When I asked what our Harald could do once he was classified by the system, he said that he didn’t stand a chance because “cruelty is the point of the system.” The phrase was a reference to a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/665171/the-cruelty-is-the-point-by-adam-serwer/">book of the same name</a> that dissects Trump politics, and while the situation might not always be as dire as it is now in the US, it’s good to keep the point in mind.</p> <p>AI systems, as you know, are often sold as a benevolent measure, a productivity boost, and as the next big step towards digitization. But AI systems simply enforce the policy of the public institutions they are implemented in. As we saw above, if the job agency pursues a policy of sanctioning people who do not work, then that is what the AI system will do better, faster, stronger. It is for this reason that, whenever you study the screwups of public AI systems, you will find that these screwups directly trace back to issues that are very deeply rooted in the institutional structure and policy decisions governing this structure. While the first and second arguments assumed that using an algorithm to replace humans was an honest mistake, this argument assumes that its use is part of a policy that does not look favourably upon long-term job-seekers.</p> <p>Let’s take an example – and this one has a particular pain to it. In my interviews I spoke to many job-seekers to find out how they would feel about an AI system that would predict their employment chance, and what they would need to know to fully grasp what’s going on in this system. Many times these participants told me that they found the system was a wonderful idea, since now finally they would get an unbiased and precise picture of their employment chance. The system gave them hope. Hope placed in a system that could be put in place expressly with the intention to enforce sanctions and rationalize cost-cutting on their end. Quite easily as well, by adopting the restriction that only women could have duty of care for family and ranking them lower for it, and by giving everybody from outside the EU an automatic malus [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1553/ita-pb-2020-02">2</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3217/978-3-85125-668-0-16">6</a>]. This system might be the very opposite of individual support and counsel. And yet, in some cases, even after I explained to them what happen, the job-seekers still vouched for the system, saying it couldn’t be worse than the counsellors they had met. They vouched for the human mulcher in the hope that it wouldn’t mulch so hard. How bad does a public agency need to screw up to get people to say stuff like that?</p> <p>For every AI system that is deployed in public institutions, we need to ask ourselves: Which structures will this system inherit, and whose tune will it dance to? AI deployment is guided by political interest [<a href="https://katecrawford.net/atlas">3</a>, <a href="https://timothee-schmude.github.io/blog/2022/ai-atlas/">see also</a>], just like everything else, and thinking that AI would un-bias and de-politicize any sphere of public interest is an illusion. To make the point clear: Say an institution is charged with the dismantling of other public institutions, just as we currently observe in the US, and presents a new AI system that is titled the <em>Human Resource Upgrader</em> – how much hope would you place in this system to upgrade the human resources of anything? It’s not about what’s on the label, it’s about what’s in the can.</p> <p>This is why it is important to know what’s going on in the system and how you can raise objections against it: <a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/incidents/">There’s a good chance that an AI system is not acting in your interest</a>. If cruelty is the point of the system, then it <em>will</em> inflict harm. Knowing who is responsible for this harm, and, most importantly, not trusting the AI to have your wellbeing in mind, is crucial to prevent algorithmic fallout.</p> <p>Coincidentally, we have published some research on making it easier for people to know what’s going on in an AI system.

A list of books and publishers is at the end.</em></p> <h3 id="exhausting-reading-and-pleasant-reading">Exhausting reading and pleasant reading</h3> <p>Unsurprisingly, a large part of what constitutes a PhD is reading. For me, this reading consists of scanning through conference papers and journals and the occasional book to find the ones that matter and then going over them carefully to note down the key points. While this exercise can be fun and illuminating, it also tends to be <em>exhausting</em>.</p> <p>Well, that’s part of the job, right? Right, but the thing is: Exhausting reading tends to make people not wanting to read anything in their free time. I’ve heard from more than a couple people that the slog of gathering information has burned their interest in pleasant reading – the type you do at home to have fun and relax and replenish. And I fully sympathize! I don’t want to be exhausted when reading in my free time, which is why I read fiction for most of my life: fantasy and science fiction in the beginning, then classics and German pop literature, until lately arriving at semi-fictional books that describe more or less real events (examples? Here you go: Any Human Heart, In Cold Blood, Montauk, Caspar Hauser, Licht scheint auf mein Dach).</p> <p>Only after making it through these books without being too exhausted, I gave non-fiction books a try. I started with history (Napoleon, of course) and astronomy (death of the universe), which are two specimen of a wonderful book genre that makes a real effort in conveying dry matter with true and captivating enthusiasm – and for these reasons are ideal candidates for pleasant reading.</p> <p>By now, I encountered several fantastic books in that very niche that I wanted to talk about at some point. Hence, this is a round of flash-reviews of pleasurable non-fiction books that I can recommend. Disclaimer: These are neither very current nor coherent in topic nor connected by anything, just a selection of good non-fiction books. Namely: The Culture Map, Gorillas in the Mist, Tally’s Corner, A Gentle Guide to Research Methods, and Nuremberg Diary.</p> <div class="col-lg-4 mx-auto"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_culture_map-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_culture_map-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_culture_map-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_culture_map.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="the-culture-map-erin-meyer-2014">The Culture Map. Erin Meyer, 2014.</h3> <p>This book is an easy-to-read manual for moving and working in different cultural environments, rich with anecdotes and little episode that will make you snicker. Erin Meyer is a professor for international business and the whole thing establishes her as someone well-versed in many of the world’s cultures with a good intuition for how the working styles of these cultures interact. This intuition is cast into a set of eight scales with polar opposites at the ends: communicating, evaluating, persuading, leading, deciding, trusting, disagreeing, and scheduling. How cultures are located on these scales gives a hint on how well they harmonize. For example: Locating the Netherlands and Germany on the “leading” scale, which ranges from egalitarian on its one end to hierarchical on the other, yields one marker at the egalitarian end of the scale for the Dutch and one marker at the middle of the scale for Germans. The distance between these markers tells us that when a Dutch superordinate works with a German employee then the different expectations can lead to confusion: while the Dutch might expect employees to act independently without receiving clear directions, the German might be used to a slightly more hierarchical approach and could feel unsatisfied with the lack of guidance. My version of the “leading” scale described in the book. The difference between the Netherlands and Germany implies the two cultures have different expectations towards leading and being led.</p> <p>The resulting scales are lovely to compare different countries and to produce pretty parallel coordinate charts that, according to Meyer, can give people a better idea of why they don’t feel quite well in another culture’s working environment. Together with the book’s many stories and hints this amounts to a useful collection of how-tos for dealing with challenging international settings. There is a minor caveat though: being used to the exhausting reading that defines PhD life, one wonders how these pretty scales were compiled and calculated, exactly. Erin Meyer does not go into detail about the data the scales are based on, nor does she explain how it was sourced and why some countries show up and others don’t. My best guess: The scales are a combination of her professional experience and her research on the topic, which is hinted at in the references but never spelled out. Be that as it may, when you can take these academic imperfections with a grain of salt – seeing that the likely audience isn’t academics, but executives who like applicable knowledge – the book opens up a whole range of interesting and useful perspectives on cultural differences and similarities.</p> <p>Thanks go to Jan Wiegner for the tip!</p> <div class="col-lg-4 mx-auto"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_fossey-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_fossey-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_fossey-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_fossey.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="gorillas-in-the-mist-dian-fossey-1983">Gorillas in the Mist. Dian Fossey, 1983.</h3> <p>You might know Jane Goodall, the famous chimpanzee researcher. Dian Fossey was the same kind of dedicated, uncompromising wildlife researcher, who spent decades of her life in the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park to study mountain gorillas. This book is an account of her experiences in the field, first and foremost capturing the surprisingly intricate behaviour and family dynamics of mountain gorillas – a species that counted a total of 240 animals in the wild in 1983. The story follows the emergence, growth, and dissolving of four mountain gorilla groups, whose individuals are given idiosyncratic and witty names to keep track. Aside from the fascination of reading about mountain gorillas and the natural habitats of the volcanic jungles, the report also offers detailed accounts of all the challenges Fossey met when fighting to preserve the park and her research centre. Most chapters describe collisions with the corrupt local government and poachers, who were undisturbed in laying traps for bushbuck and other game in the national park. As these traps pose a mortal danger to gorillas, Fossey did not hesitate to pick up the fight against poaching in Karisoke by enforcing nature preservation laws, a kind of activism that she calls – and this was enlightening – conservation. She fights this battle within the range of civility, enlisting the local militia to aid her efforts and raising funds for the park’s protection. But one soon begins to understand that her hard efforts in conservation created many enemies for her, likely leading to her violent murder in 1985 – two years after this book was published.</p> <p>Gorillas in the Mist is an important book for both researchers and environmentalists. Not only does it describe the subject of research in an easily accessible, fascinating and love-inducing way – enriched further by photo series taken by Fossey herself –, it also shows a person invested with her full life in protecting what she studies. Though Fossey did not seem to be an easy person. Accounts of her students and collaborators describe her as hard beyond measure, demanding, and in pursuit of her own goals with little regard for anything else other than the wildlife in Karisoke. Personally, I believe that only characters such as these can endure the pressure and danger brought on by extreme situations such as the study of mountain gorillas in a time where nobody gave two thoughts about their conservation. If you are intrigued by these characters, by the study of wildlife, and by the description the exhilarating, egregious circumstances of field research, then this book is for you.</p> <div class="col-lg-4 mx-auto"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_tally-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_tally-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_tally-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_tally.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="tallys-corner-elliott-liebow-1967">Tally’s Corner. Elliott Liebow, 1967.</h3> <p>Liebow was an urban anthropologist who in the 60s immersed himself in the life of “streetcorner men”: a demographic of mostly black men who spent their time at the streetcorners of Washington D.C. with infrequent employments, loose relationships and uncertain prospects. The book is the description of Liebow’s ethnographic study with 24 of these men, in which he became their acquaintance or friend and tried to identify the factors that contributed to their situation and position in society. Every chapter focuses on another area of life – employment, education, friendships, dating, family relations, etc. – and combines them to paint a comprehensive picture of the circumstances that keep the men in the vicious cycle, despite their best efforts to escape it. Criticism claims that the book, which was Liebow’s PhD thesis, underexplores the role that systematic racism plays. I will naturally not argue against these claims, but personally found that the effects of institutional racism, even if not explicitly discussed, are visibly embedded in every fate that Liebow describes and do leave their marks in the reader.</p> <p>The book’s last chapter contains Liebow’s meta-reflections on the experience of conducting an ethnographic field study in the streets of Washington D.C. and holds precious insight for anyone who plans to talk to people as part of their research. What Fossey’s book does for wildlife and conservation, Liebow’s book does for anthropology and social studies, and I can fully recommend both as captivating examples for academic studies that go beyond the narrow circle of academia to present their contents in a way that makes them accessible, fascinating, and relevant for everyone.</p> <div class="col-lg-4 mx-auto"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_lovecraft-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_lovecraft-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_lovecraft-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_lovecraft.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Yes, this is not the main book I'm describing below, but isn't it simply the most awesome book cover?!

Gordon Rugg and Marian Petre, 2007.</h3> <p>Someone who talks about academic studies all the time is bound to mention a methods book somewhere. Granted: This one is more relevant for young researchers who are not yet firm in how the basics of research methods are done: a usually rather dry matter, but this book succeeds marvellously in conveying it! For starters, the authors precede each chapter with quotes, often taken from H. P. Lovecraft’s fantasy novels on cosmic horrors beyond human imagination (here’s a hidden book tip! Houellebecq’s great criticism of Lovecraft, Against the World, Against Life). Moreover, it’s a methods book written in simple, coherent, and entertaining style – three things that you would absolutely not expect this genre to nail. In a nutshell: If you are looking for a book to teach you about the basics of empirical research, look no further. By the way: One of the authors is a computer scientist, so there’s no question of whether the described information is also relevant to fields outside of the social sciences.</p> <div class="col-lg-4 mx-auto"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_nuremberg-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_nuremberg-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_nuremberg-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/book_recom_nuremberg.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="nuremberg-diary-gustave-gilbert-1947">Nuremberg Diary. Gustave Gilbert, 1947.</h3> <p>Gilbert was the court psychologist assigned by the Allied Forces to speak to the nazi leaders who were awaiting their trials in Nuremberg after the war had ended. In his function, Gilbert had the singular and bizarre opportunity to converse with the nazis, including Göring, Speer, Hess, and 17 others. As they perceived him as external to the proceedings in his profession as a doctor, they confided to him many of their thoughts regarding the Second World War, the rise of the nazi party, Hitler’s personality, and the holocaust. This book is the chronological collection of his diary entries as court psychologist, structured along his conversations with the detained nazi leaders and the court proceedings, ending with the executions.</p> <p>German school education imprints in oneself a deep and uncompromising perspective on Nazi Germany, established post-war to prevent Germans from ever following this kind of ideology again. Due to this important and incessant impression during school years, I didn’t feel a particular interest in following up on the topic myself, feeling that I had a good grasp on the most important aspects of what happened in that time (which, unfortunately, wasn’t quite true). This interest was invoked again by two books, which gave perspectives that our school education simply did not cover. The first one was Jean Améry’s account of his experience in Nazi Germany, At the Mind’s Limits, and the second one was the Nuremberg Diary. In general, the book is comparable to Hannah Arendt’s descriptions of the Eichman processes. But the scope is slightly shifted in that the conversations between Gilbert and the nazis let the reader experience the nazis’ thoughts in a way that I rarely saw before. It is difficult to find words for everything described in this text – the endless denials of guilt, the spurious justifications, the claimed ignorance –, but the book deeply embeds into one’s consciousness an idea of the personalities who were responsible for these crimes, and what little they had to say in their defence. In these terms, I recommend this book firstly for its captivating historical account, and secondly for its important part in general education. List of books</p> <p>Thanks for reading!

Here’s the TL;DR: Talking to people is a good idea if you want to find out which explanations they need. But analysing what they tell you is a different story, especially if it’s surprising and confusing. To get the most out of it, abductive analysis has three recommendations: revisit your data, defamiliarize yourself, and use alternative theoretical casings. The list at the end explains what these mean.</em></p> <h3 id="discovering-people">Discovering people</h3> <p>Explainable AI is in the process of discovering that what you explain will not necessarily arrive at your audience the way you intended. Instead, your message will be jumbled and warped by all things separating you from them: the computer, the language, the difference in knowledge between you, the way in which you typically explain things to yourself, and so on. Graduating in Media Studies has its payoff at this (and only this) exact point – hear now a sacral choir chanting: “The medium is the message” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">context</a>).</p> <p>Yes, but how does this help in explaining AI? At first, it only suggests to us to take a look beyond the idea of quantifying understanding and perceptions and get a good grasp of the human behind these metrics. In short: Speak to who you’re talking to. Doing so will yield quite surprising insights like ‘people tend to judge a system based on the institution deploying it’ [1] and ‘understanding has both rational and emotional facets’ [2]. These insights can then, with a bit of polishing and interpretation, be fed back into XAI to improve explanation design – at least that’s the idea.</p> <h3 id="talking-to-people">Talking to people</h3> <p>Talking to people is a craft well established in the Social Sciences, which provide a plethora of methods, measures, and concepts to find out how people interact, acquire knowledge, and split the burden of understanding. After XAI discovered humans (I’m exaggerating), several researchers wrote papers that made an effort to build bridges to this fountain of wisdom that is the Social Sciences. Two of the rather important ones were Miller’s summary of things to know about human explanations [3] and Langer et al.’s model of people who have stakes in AI systems [4] (which, to be fair, is based on previous work by Arrieta et al. 2019 [5]). Finally, with a little shove from HCI – a field that discovered humans a good while back – a new sub-field emerged: Human-centred explainable AI, or HCXAI.</p> <p>This is our ‘You are here’ red dot starting point: Explanations are not created in a vacuum nor do they arrive in one, so we would do good to consider all steps of the way. There is an argument to be made that XAI cannot possibly be responsible for how people process the information that we convey, and there might be ‘handoff’-point at which this might be true, but, personally, I feel we have not yet arrived there. Rather, we should first try to talk to all the stakeholders we identified two years back and find out what they would like to know.</p> <h3 id="understanding-what-people-say">Understanding what people say</h3> <p>This brings us to the practical, tutorial-like part of this text. I can now reveal that all of the above was pretence for an excuse to write about the obscure strand of qualitative research called ‘abductive analysis’ – and here we are! Do not quit yet! I’ll promise I’ll try to make it entertaining.</p> <p>Imagine you talked to 30 people that you sourced from the local job agency in a very hot Viennese summer, something I’m incidentally most familiar with. You presented explanations about the system you are trying to study, recorded what people said in response and ended up with 30 one-hour interview transcripts. A giant amount of text for computer science standards, but a dwarf amount compared to what social scientists typically have to battle. The question that abductive analysis – and any qualitative analysis for that matter – tries to answer is: How do you make sense of all the things said?</p> <p>There are two main and not too complex answers to this question: Either you dive into the data and build themes from what people said, or you tap into the literature to find your themes and then see if they connect to what people said. The first one is called inductive, the second one deductive analysis (and yes, I will draw the anger of the qualitative research gods with this simplified account).</p> <p>While there exist strong opinions that either inductive or deductive analysis is the ground truth, a most intuitive way of going about analysing data like these interview transcripts is to combine the two. On the one hand, the literature certainly provides some topics that people typically talk about when trying to understand explanations of AI (such as fairness, the application context, and the technical details), on the other, you might well find things that the literature does not yet cover (such as the developer’s intention and the cost of deploying a model). So as not to spoil your naïve view, you first go through the transcripts and create categories from what you find in the data, and then you look into literature to see if anything matches. Indeed, some things were known before, others do neatly complement what’s already known, but then again, there is data that makes no sense at all. Why does participant 7-A not trust the study procedure? Why does participant 11-B talk about his relationship to his brother when asked about his understanding? And what do you do with the endless opinions that crop up all over your data (‘This whole algorithm thing is nonsense.’)?</p> <h3 id="enter-abductive-analysis">Enter abductive analysis</h3> <p>Abductive analysis makes these idiosyncratic, inconvenient, confusing parts of the data a centrepiece of analysis. After all, why is it not apparent what these parts mean? Because their relation to the study goals is not clear, meaning they relate to something you did not consider, but which apparently does play a role in the real world and therefore – and this is the catch – will also play a role when your or anyone’s AI explanation will be used in the real world to provide information to this audience. This is an actual, not to be underestimated limitation.</p> <p>There are three key parts to abductive analysis that all try to help you in producing interesting data and getting a hold of it to gain insight: revisiting, defamiliarization, and alternative casing. The whole idea goes back to Charles Peirce’s work from the 1930’s and is often summarized with the following triplet:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The surprising fact C is observed.</p> </li> <li> <p>But if A were true, C would be a matter of course.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hence, there is a reason to suspect that A is true. [6]</p> </li> </ul> <p>You will be glad to hear there’s more up-to-date literature describing the method, namely Timmermans’ and Tavory’s paper from 2012 [7] and their book from 2014 [8]. More or less helpfully, they explain:</p> <p>“<em>[A]bduction is the form of reasoning through which we perceive the phenomenon as related to other observations either in the sense that there is a cause and effect hidden from view, in the sense that the phenomenon is seen as similar to other phenomena already experienced and explained in other situations, or in the sense of creating new general descriptions.</em>” [7]</p> <p>In an effort to ground the whole thing, they add that everyone performs abduction whenever they experience something surprising in their life, drawing from their existent knowledge to incorporate the new observations. Two aspects helped me to get into this train of thought: First, ‘abducting’ means leading away: surprising insights lead us away from known theories to new ones. Second, the position of the researcher is important: depending on what you know and how you think, you will produce other insights than the next person, even if you’re from the same field. I put together a diagram for myself that semi-aptly tries to capture the idea. My idea of how abductive analysis arrives at theory: Explanations for surprising evidence are considered and applied by revisiting and defamiliarizing data. Finally, when no theory sufficiently explains a piece of data, a new theory is created.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/abduction_process-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/abduction_process-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/abduction_process-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/abduction_process.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My idea of how abductive analysis arrives at theory: Explanations for surprising evidence are considered and applied by revisiting and defamiliarizing data.

Here is my interpretation of how to apply the trinity of abductive analysis in your qualitative work:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Revisit the phenomenon</strong>: Qualitative data is overwhelming, our perception can’t handle all of it in one go. Take time, let the data lie for a bit and come back with fresh eyes. Check your field notes, write memos, try to re-experience your data over a stretch of time and you will find that there’s more to see every time you come back</li> <li><strong>Defamiliarize yourself</strong>: What you know guides what you perceive. Try to alienate yourself from your data, estrange the familiar, put your textual data in spoken word and vice versa to notice things you previously took for granted. Where revisiting is about perceiving data at different times, defamiliarization is about perceiving it from a semantic distance</li> <li><strong>Use alternative casings</strong>: Theories serve as guidelines for how we analyse data, changing theories means changing guidelines. Connect your data to multiple theoretical frameworks to understand the data in as many ways as possible. When analysing data is a puzzle, changing our theoretical positionality will present us with a new puzzle to solve each time. [7, 8]</li> </ul> <p>And with that I leave you. My feelings towards abductive analysis are of fascination and confusion in equal parts and indeed I have turned and twisted these ideas in my head for a few weeks now, trying to find a perspective that allows for easy application. Despite the title of this article, what perspectives I have found so far don’t take the form of a manual, but rather lead to a change in consciousness for how empirical studies allow us to gather and understand data. In my case, it sparked confidence that producing surprising and irritating data is not only allowed, but even desirable.</p> <p><strong>Inspiring or puzzling?

It is easy to associate the text-to-image generation model <a href="https://timothee-schmude.github.io/blog/2022/dall-e/">Dall-E</a> with the term, or translation software like DeepL, recommender systems used by Netflix or YouTube, and various forms of personal assistants such as Alexa or Siri. Even robots turn out to be a common first thought when talking about AI. But the vital point that Atlas of AI makes is that AI has long eclipsed its usage in mere consumer products and tools. Artificial Intelligence, Kate Crawford argues, is conquering a ”much wider set of political and social structures” and is “ultimately designed to serve existing dominant interests”. In a profound analysis backed by tremendous amounts of research, the book reveals to us that AI is primarily a “registry of power”, and that we should beware.</p> <p>Crawford’s magnificent way of presenting us with this evidence is by telling stories that take us by the hand and say ‘Look, over there, this is the Silver Peak Lithium Mine, where residue from pumping up lithium brine gathers in large, toxic lakes.’, or ‘This is the Armour Beef dressing floor, where workers were the first to take their place in an assembly line, much as they do at Amazon today, where things are spiced up by automated time control.’ Not only are the examples historic, they are graphic, tangible, and they illustrate so well what is missing from our present conception of AI: The dirty, sweaty, greasy foundation on which it is built both materially, and, as it turns out, scientifically.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_lake-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_lake-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_lake-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_lake.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Chemetall Foote Lithium Operation in Clayton Valley. Photo by Magnus Manske. </div> <p>My favorite episode in this path of realization is Crawford’s visit to Samuel Morton’s cranial collection, a large amount of skulls gathered and labelled by the craniologist in the 19th century to explore if intelligence and “superiority” could be inferred from the size and structure of the human skull, establishing a deeply flawed and racist take on anatomy. This is the introduction to the book’s section on Classification and it is so rich in history and symbolism that it is nothing short of literary, and thus so suitable for the introduction of a central question: Who is the one holding the power to decide over what ought to be classified, and which classes to use? Of course, Crawford argues, the ones performing these classifications have rarely been the minorities and fringe groups, but the ruling class. It is no large leap of mind to realize that these classifications were not put in place in order to infringe on the ruling class’ control and influence, but to increase and cement them. The achievement of the <em>Atlas of AI</em> is not only to unveil the bizarre building blocks of present-day AI, but also to steer these questions back to the present, connecting them to discussions about bias and surveillance. After taking in the historic panorama that Crawford develops before us, we lastly arrive at the present with a quaint little image of a skull that reminds us of where it all started.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_skulls-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_skulls-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_skulls-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/ai_atlas_skulls.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Labelled Skulls in Morton cranial collection.

Each of these elements has secrets to tell and by the end we do not assume that anything about AI is without costs, only that they are hidden behind lofty curtains of marketing façade and a general, convenient confusion.</p> <p>I do not want to tell you all the brilliant bits in advance. If you are interested in Artificial Intelligence, working in the field, or reflecting on it, then I wholeheartedly recommend this book and indeed urge you to read it. I had not thought about tracing AI by notions of geography and history in this manner, showing us just how closely connected to political power it is, and so it is not overstating to say that the <em>Atlas of AI</em> opened up my horizon by a considerable margin.</p> <p>Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence.

So famous, in fact, that OpenAI decided that AI should not be open after all and sealed GPT-3 behind a wall of exclusivity only to be conquered by formal application or by, you know, paying. People that got through this application step tell intriguing tales about all the things that can be done with the model, among them <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/gpt-3-tries-pickup-lines/">GPT-3 trying pickup lines</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/i-wrote-a-book-with-gpt-3-ai-in-24-hours-and-got-it-published-93cf3c96f120">GPT-3 writing books</a>, <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/will-ai-write-next-great-american-novel">GPT-3 composing poetry</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/icvypl/list_of_free_sitesprograms_that_are_powered_by/">GPT-3 doing basically everything else</a>.</p> <p>Setting aside the slightly dystopian implications for the moment, OpenAI in January last year announced yet another machine learning model with impressive capability: DALL·E. This one can generate images from any text that you give it, that is, it takes your words and tries to render a visual interpretation of them. The resulting images are not unlike those from <a href="https://research.google/blog/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural-networks/">DeepDream</a> and <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a> (though those are different architectures). Apparently, the most intuitive thing to ask such a machine is to produce an image of a chair in the form of an avocado, which promptly became DALL·E’s emblem.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts_images/dall_e_avocado_chair-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts_images/dall_e_avocado_chair-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts_images/dall_e_avocado_chair-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts_images/dall_e_avocado_chair.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Avocado chair.

In theory this should result in a singular view on the world: a direct transport line between verbal imagination and graphic depiction, heavily influenced by whatever transformation the model performs on the input. And indeed the results appear to live up to this promise.

GPT-3, DALL·E’s base model, was trained on numerous texts from the web (the so-called Common Crawl and the whole of Wikipedia) and a lot of books. “Numerous” is understating: they are gigantic amounts. Towering, unimaginable amounts, impossible to grasp – you know the scales. The point is: most of this is human language. Every piece of text has an author, a date of publication, a context, and human views and opinions embedded deeply into it. This is no bad thing! It just means that when we are looking at GPT-3’s output, we are looking at the (mostly intransparent) transformation of a large volume of human language, cast into a specific form, like a distillation of everything that was said in the last 100 years – by certain people, in certain places.</p> <p>On a side note: The process of transforming various inputs by the workings of an opaque machinery into something new actually sounds familiar – humans do it all the time. Of course, this is no clean analogy, there are multiple things we don’t understand about consciousness and the brain. Ironically though, we don’t understand everything about neural networks either. Our not-knowing how is a pretty straight parallel between the two concepts (and something we work on in <a href="[url](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEAbSeLC_M0IA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1654948411676?e=1746057600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=FnIkQJfdVHQRyPU8Cy414VnuqxCLeMNCNqSfCNkivDc)">our research project</a>).</p> <p>DALL·E was trained in a similar fashion to GPT-3: by collecting numerous text and image pairs from the internet, since it’s cheap and it’s there. One part comes from Wikipedia, the other part from Flickr. This means we get data from people hanging out on a) Wikipedia, and b) Flickr. Again, nothing to fret about necessarily, just something to keep in mind when looking at the applications of DALL·E. As a reminder, facial recognition systems couldn’t (or might still be unable to) handle images of black women as they were underrepresented in the training data. Thankfully, there are researchers occupying themselves with revealing and dealing with these discriminatory biases. Unluckily, big tech doesn’t always seem to like what they find and prefers to sanction them. Two prominent researches who left (or were made to leave) Google because of this are Margaret Mitchell and Timnit Gebru.</p> <p>Coming back to the practical part of the model, you certainly would like to try your hands at it yourself. Good news! There is a <a href="[url](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini)">mini version of DALL·E over at HuggingFace</a> that let’s you play around with it, it is slow and not as good as the original, but still a lot of fun. You can also build the thing yourself, if you want, they put the <a href="[url](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini)">code for DALL·E Mini on Github</a>. (HuggingFace really are accommodating in giving access)</p> <p>Alright, let’s see if it delivers!

If you do a google image search you will see that this is rather prototypical. Still, as a distillation of human ideas about life after death, this is not bad at all. As someone who also dove into literature analysis a couple of times, the possibility of interpreting symbolism and composition of these images is very intriguing. Incidentally, I have done something similar in my master’s thesis, but that’s a story for another time.</p> <p>Suppose we had a fully working model of DALL·E, imagine the implications. Every photograph, be it for ads or articles, could be generated, every book cover, every movie poster, theoretically, every frame of a movie as well. This is science fiction, of course, but it slowly transcends into the realm of reality. Indeed, if you can make a profit on it, the thing is shoved into reality in the bat of an eye. And what do you know, there is a new version already! OpenAI presents: <a href="https://openai.com/index/dall-e-2/">DALL·E 2</a>.</p> <p>The important question is, if AI was perfect, and if AI could generate every image possible, would you still look at a human one?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing around with image generating AI]]></summary></entry></feed>
