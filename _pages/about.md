Hi! I'm Timoth√©e, a PhD student at the <a href='https://vda.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/1001666/#publications'>University of Vienna</a> working on explainable and contestable AI. My research focuses on how explanations of algorithmic systems are understood by people and uses qualitative methods to evaluate explanation approaches with stakeholders in interview settings. The latest projects examine the information needs and understanding processes of AI novices, explanation designs for group deliberations, and regulation of explainable and contestable AI.
