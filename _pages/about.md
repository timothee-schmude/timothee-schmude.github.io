Hi! I'm TimothÃ©e, a PhD student at the <a href='https://vda.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/1001666/#publications'>University of Vienna</a> working on explainable and contestable AI. I'm interested in how explanations help people understand and challenge algorithmic systems and conduct interviews and workshops to investigate these topics. My latest projects look at the information needs of AI novices, explanation design for group decision-making, and regulation of explainable and contestable AI.

The quote above is about Weizenbaum's chatbot ELIZA, which very soon turned into a therapy bot for his colleagues and peers. In turn, he re-baptized the bot as DOCTOR. It's a cute story and a reminder that humans look for humanness in everything.

In my free time, I like to go hiking and climbing, and I recently acquired a taste for knitting. I'm also enthusiastic about all sorts of books, my latest reads include <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People'>*Careless people*</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness'>*Factfulness*</a>,
