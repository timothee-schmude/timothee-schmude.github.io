These stakeholders, whom we call decision subjects, have a right to understand how their outcome was produced and to challenge it. Explanations should support this process by making the algorithmic system transparent and creating an understanding of its inner workings. However, we argue that while current explanation approaches focus on descriptive explanations, decision subjects also require normative explanations or justifications. In this position paper, we advocate for justifications as a key component in explanation approaches for decision subjects and make three claims to this end, namely that justifications i) fulfill decision subjects’ information needs, ii) shape their intent to accept or contest decisions, and iii) encourage accountability considerations throughout the system’s lifecycle. We propose four guiding principles for the design of justifications, provide two design examples, and close with directions for future work. With this paper, we aim to provoke thoughts on the role, value, and design of normative information in explainable AI for decision subjects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100"> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706599.3721096" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CHI EA 25</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="schmude2025explainandcontest" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Explainability and Contestability for the Responsible Use of Public Sector AI</div> <div class="author"> <em>Timothée Schmude</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Extended Abstracts of CHI’ 25</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3706599.3721096" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Schmude%20et%20al.%20-%202025%20-%20Explainability%20and%20Contestability%20for%20the%20Responsible%20Use%20of%20Public%20Sector%20AI.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Public institutions have begun to use AI systems in areas that directly impact people’s lives, including labor, law, health, and migration. Explainability ensures that these systems are understandable to the involved stakeholders, while its emerging counterpart contestability enables them to challenge AI decisions. Both principles support the responsible use of AI systems, but their implementation needs to take into account the needs of people without technical background, AI novices. I conduct interviews and workshops to explore how explainable AI can be made suitable for AI novices, how explanations can support their agency by allowing them to contest decisions, and how this intersection is conceptualized. My research aims to inform policy and public institutions on how to implement responsible AI by designing for explainability and contestability. The Remote Doctoral Consortium would allow me to discuss with peers how these principles can be realized and account for human factors in their design.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2024.103380" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IJHCS</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="schmude2024_ai_novices" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Information that matters: Exploring information needs of people affected by algorithmic decisions</div> <div class="author"> <em>Timothée Schmude</em>, Laura Koesten, Torsten Möller, and Sebastian Tschiatschek </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>International Journal of Human-Computer Studies</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2024.103380" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Schmude%20et%20al.%20-%202024%20-%20Information%20That%20Matters_Exploring%20Information%20Needs%20of%20People%20Affected%20by%20Algorithmic%20Decisions.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Every AI system that makes decisions about people has a group of stakeholders that are personally affected by these decisions. However, explanations of AI systems rarely address the information needs of this stakeholder group, who often are AI novices. This creates a gap between conveyed information and information that matters to those who are impacted by the system’s decisions, such as domain experts and decision subjects. To address this, we present the “XAI Novice Question Bank”, an extension of the XAI Question Bank (Liao et al., 2020) containing a catalog of information needs from AI novices in two use cases: employment prediction and health monitoring. The catalog covers the categories of data, system context, system usage, and system specifications. We gathered information needs through task based interviews where participants asked questions about two AI systems to decide on their adoption and received verbal explanations in response. Our analysis showed that participants’ confidence increased after receiving explanations but that their understanding faced challenges. These included difficulties in locating information and in assessing their own understanding, as well as attempts to outsource understanding. Additionally, participants’ prior perceptions of the systems’ risks and benefits influenced their information needs. Participants who perceived high risks sought explanations about the intentions behind a system’s deployment, while those who perceived low risks rather asked about the system’s operation. Our work aims to support the inclusion of AI novices in explainability efforts by highlighting their information needs, aims, and challenges. We summarize our findings as five key implications that can inform the design of future explanations for lay stakeholder audiences.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100"> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3593013.3594054" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FAccT 23</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="schmude2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On the Impact of Explanations on Understanding of Algorithmic Decision-Making</div> <div class="author"> <em>Timothée Schmude</em>, Laura Koesten, Torsten Möller, and Sebastian Tschiatschek </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT)</em>, Chicago, IL, USA, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3593013.3594054" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Schmude%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20On%20the%20Impact%20of%20Explanations%20on%20Understanding%20of%20Algorithmic%20Decision-Making.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Ethical principles for algorithms are gaining importance as more and more stakeholders are affected by "high-risk" algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems. Understanding how these systems work enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and to assess the systems’ adherence to ethical values. Explanations are a promising way to create understanding, but current explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) research does not always consider existent theories on how understanding is formed and evaluated. In this work, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of understanding by conducting a qualitative task-based study with 30 participants, including users and affected stakeholders. We use three explanation modalities (textual, dialogue, and interactive) to explain a "high-risk" ADM system to participants and analyse their responses both inductively and deductively, using the "six facets of understanding" framework by Wiggins &amp; McTighe [63]. Our findings indicate that the "six facets" framework is a promising approach to analyse participants’ thought processes in understanding, providing categories for both rational and emotional understanding. We further introduce the "dialogue" modality as a valid explanation approach to increase participant engagement and interaction with the "explainer", allowing for more insight into their understanding in the process. Our analysis further suggests that individuality in understanding affects participants’ perceptions of algorithmic fairness, demonstrating the interdependence between understanding and ADM assessment that previous studies have outlined. We posit that drawing from theories on learning and understanding like the "six facets" and leveraging explanation modalities can guide XAI research to better suit explanations to learning processes of individuals and consequently enable their assessment of ethical values of ADM systems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%74%69%6D%6F%74%68%65%65.%73%63%68%6D%75%64%65@%75%6E%69%76%69%65.%61%63.%61%74" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=clG_VOgAAAAJ&amp;hl" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timothee-Schmude/" title="ResearchGate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-researchgate"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timoth%C3%A9e-schmude-17a032218" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/13440007" title="Stackoverflow" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-stack-overflow"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note">Don’t hesitate to get in touch!
